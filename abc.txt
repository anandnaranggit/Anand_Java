seeing if this is in new
now doing this in vi in master. I made a change in the master using vi, i did
a checkout newb and it shows in newb. 
Now making change in newb using vi and seeing if the change is seen in master
yes it gets seen in master.
-----------------------
now going to newb and making changes, adding the file and then seeing if the change is seen in master
------------------changes are still seen in master

now agoing to newb and adding and committing the change, will then go to master to check if it gets updated.
=================
this example we are makign the change in master adding and committing the file in master and then will move to newb to see what happens
